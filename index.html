          Where Wolf? Morrison-Richardson‚Äôs motto is ‚ÄúUna in Anima Concordes‚Äù (United as one soul). Wally the White wolf is a symbol of the fearlessness of the house in the face of adversity, never bowing down to challenges and aptly describes this strength of togetherness, embodied by the forming of a closely-knit wolf pack. However, now a quest awaits so continue on your hunt!
